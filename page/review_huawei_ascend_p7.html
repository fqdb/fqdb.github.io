	<h1>User review - Huawei Ascend P7</h2>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Ascend P7 is one of the slimmest 4G enabled devices, and features a sleek glass and aluminium body and two high resolution camera's. Yet it sells for a under â‚¬300. Is that as good of a deal as it seems?</p>
	
	<h2>First impressions</h2>
	<p>At first the Ascend P7 doesn't look that spectacular. Another black slab of a phone maybe. But once you pick it up, it feels special because of two things: the weight - a mere 124 grams - and the thinness - an incredible 6.5mm. When you turn the phone around, the glass back with a nice pattern catches your eye. The pattern is comparable to the Nexus 4/LG G Pro, but on the Huawei it's circular. The sides of the phone are uncluttered, with the left side empty, and two inobtrusive SIM card and micro SD card trays, a well placed power button and a volume rocker.</p>
	
	<h2>Hardware</h2>
	
	
	<h2>Software</h2>
	<p>The P7 comes with Huawei's Emotion UI (EMUI), the most notable feature is the lack of an app drawer in the stock launcher. The EMUI skin is nothing to write home about, but it's not terrible either. Some basic useful additions to stock Android are there: status bar toggles, themes, dynamic wallpaper slide show. The white-themed skin features several skeumorphic effects like 3D toggles and overly detailed icons, but overall it's much less intrusive than older TouchWiz or LG UI versions. The stock apps like the calculator and music player are fully loaded with 3D effects, but you can just use your own apps to replace them. Speaking about the stock apps, I found none of them outstanding, or better than free apps from the Play Store. To me, the EMUI skin feels like a bastard child between MIUI V4 and LG's UI, which isn't as bad as it may sound.</p>
	<p>When you do want to get rid of flaws or lack of features in the EMUI skin, you're pretty much out of luck though. The P7's bootloader is actually <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/ascend-p7/general/unlock-bootloader-huawei-ascend-p7-l10-t2830641">unlocked out of the box</a>, but the developer scene for the P7 isn't very active and the in-house HiSilicon SoC makes porting over software from other devices a lot more difficult. Using the Xposed framework to add or remove UI elements isn't possible either, Emotion UI is locked tight and the UI framework is heavily customized. You can however still install the Xposed framework, but only modules that change third party apps will work.</p>
	
	<h2>Camera</h2>
	<p>When reading the specsheet, you might find something off. An 8MP front camera? That must be an error right? Well, it isn't. The back camera is a 13MP Sony sensor, which is pretty standard for a 2014 premium phone. Specs don't tell that much when it comes to camera quality, so let's look at some sample photo's first.</p>
