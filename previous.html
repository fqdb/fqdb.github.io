	<h2>Previous work</p>
	<h3>Tocano</h3>
	<p>Tocano is a technology startup company based in Delft. During a summer internship I was involved in setting up the prototyping rig, doing scientific research and testing with new equipment and materials. Equipment includes high power lasers, linear actuators and microcontrollers.</p>
	<p>Besides learning commercial prototyping, I also learned a lot of 'soft knowledge' working in a university lab and with all the joys and troubles of working at a startup.</p>
	<p>I can't get into too much detail, since the company is working in stealth mode. Watch their website to see if they have published any more information yet: <a href="http://www.tocano.nl/"><strong>www.tocano.nl</strong></a>

	<h3>Architecture</h3>
	<p>I followed the first year of the Bachelor program Architecture at TU Delft. Yes, you read that right.</p>
	<p>During that year I found out that I was not suited to study architecture so I decided to switch to a more scientific field. So I chose Applied Physics. Despite this switch, a lot of the things I learned at Architecture have stayed in my head. In particular architectural renders, urbanism and maps interest me.</p>
