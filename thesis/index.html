<div class="small">
As the current standard of lithium-ion batteries remain costly, fluoride-ion batteries have in recent years gained significant interest as an alternative new battery chemistry, however the technology is still at the stage of exploring which materials to use. Using a high-throughput computational approach, battery materials can be analysed fast and focused on specific limitations. 

For this research, this approach was used to study the theoretical suitability of fluoride-ion battery materials. Hundreds of fluoride compounds from the Materials Project database were collected and their electrochemical properties were calculated to compare their suitability for use in fluoride ion batteries. It is shown that based on their theoretical properties, BiF<sub>3</sub>, SnF<sub>3</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>F are the most suitable fluoride-ion battery electrode materials to use with BaSnF4 electrolyte. The electrode pair of Sn<sub>2</sub>OF<sub>5</sub>/Sn<sub>2</sub>OF<sub>2</sub> was found to be a possible intercalation electrode as it shares the same space group.

The material BiF<sub>3</sub> is an experimentally tested fluoride-ion battery electrode material which has a low ionic conductivity. Doping this material has been reported to improve its conductivity. By using first-principles density functional theorem simulations, the stability of Pnma, P6<sub>3</sub> and Fm3m space group structures of the Bi<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>F<sub>3-x</sub> (M=Sn, Ba, Pb) system were investigated. It was found that the intermediates of these three systems are stable or metastable, with especially Bi<sub>0.45</sub>Ba<sub>0.55</sub>F<sub>2.55</sub> forming a stable intermediate of the Fm3m space group. These findings show that Bi<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>F<sub>3-x</sub> (M=Sn, Ba, Pb) solid solutions are likely to be synthesizable experimentally.

The ionic conductivity of fluoride ions in BaSnF4, a solid state electrolyte, was studied using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Is it known that BaSnF4 of the P4/nmm space group has a conduction barrier formed by the Ba-Ba layer. Selective creation of fluorine vacancies in the Ba-Ba barrier layer showed improved ionic conductivity from 4.4e-3 S/cm to 1.7e-2 S/cm at room temperature.

The ionic conductivity of fluoride ions in BiF3 was studied, and specific vacancies were created targeting an improvement of the ionic conductivity. The aliovalent substitution of Sn<sub>Bi</sub>' and of v<sub>F</sub>* were simulated using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations and compared against BiF3 without defects. It was found that the combination of Sn<sub>Bi</sub>' and of v<sub>F</sub>* resulted in an improved conductivity to a much larger degree than Sn<sub>Bi</sub>' or v<sub>F</sub>* separately could accomplish. For undoped BiF<sub>3</sub> at 1000 K, a conductivity of 3.5e-3 S/cm was found and an activation energy of 1.33 eV, which was reduced to 1.0S/cm and 0.230 eV for Bi<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>F<sub>22</sub>.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past decades, the urgency to slow down climate change has
become apparent worldwide, which has led to shifts in our energy
production and consumption. On the production side, renewable energies
are often mismatched with electricity demand, requiring the need for
storage.<span class="citation" data-cites="Borah2020">(Borah et al.
2020)</span> On the consumption side, electric vehicles and mobile
devices are causing a growth in demand for batteries. Hence, there is an
increase in demand for energy storage devices, a role often fulfilled by
various types of batteries.</p>
<p>The current standard for batteries is based on lithium-ion
technology. Although there is expected to be an adequate amount of
exploitable lithium, other materials required to make current
lithium-ion batteries are rarer, and more difficult to exploit. By
weight percentage, materials such as cobalt, nickel and manganese form a
larger part of battery electrodes than lithium does.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Olivetti2017">(Olivetti et al. 2017)</span>
In addition, especially for electric vehicles, there is a strong demand
for batteries that have improved energy densities, to allow the
production of lighter and smaller vehicles that still offer an operating
range comparable to internal combustion engine vehicles. However,
revolutionary improvements of current battery technology are not close
to commercialization yet and current batteries additional have
operational drawbacks, such as poor performance at low temperatures and
flammability. Therefore, scientists and industry are also looking for
alternative battery technologies. When considering alternative battery
technologies, many of the battery properties depend on the chemistry,
such as energy density, abundance of raw materials, cost, toxicity, and
ease of manufacturing. All of these considerations may also change over
time, for example, carbon nanotubes are becoming easier and cheaper to
manufacture, whereas cobalt has become more expensive, thus what may
seem uncompetitive today could be the mainstream technology in the
future.<span class="citation" data-cites="Borah2020">(Borah et al.
2020)</span> This makes developing alternative battery technologies
worth pursuing, even if they may not be directly competitive with
lithium-ion batteries at the present time.</p>
<h3 id="the-fluoride-ion-battery">The fluoride ion battery</h3>
<p>One possible alternative battery technology is based on fluoride
ions. Fluoride ion batteries (FIB) utilize fluoride ions instead of
lithium ions to carry charge. Fluoride ions have been described as "the
mirror opposite of the lithium ion",<span class="citation"
data-cites="Miller">(Miller 2020)</span> as it carries an opposite
charge of the lithium ion, while sharing many of the lithium ions
favourable properties for use in batteries, such as low mass, small
ionic radius and high electrochemical potential. The main incentive for
looking into FIBs as an alternative to the current standard of lithium
ion batteries is that FIBs don not require the same relatively scarce
elements as lithium ion batteries.</p>
<p>Although FIBs have been researched since the 1970s, the topic did not
gain much interest until 2011.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Reddy2011">(Reddy and Fichtner 2011)</span><span
class="citation" data-cites="Nowroozi2021">(Nowroozi et al. 2021)</span>
The development of FIB, as of 2019, is reported to be at a similar level
as lithium-ion battery technology was during the 1980s, i.e. at least a
decade away from commercialisation. The research is still at the stage
of choosing which materials to use, rather than at refining the battery
design for commercial use.<span class="citation"
data-cites="bortfitz">(Bortfitz 2019)</span> This includes choosing
suitable electrode pairs, but one of the most studied topics on FIBs is
the search for a suitable electrolyte material. The material has been
experimentally tested but still requires further improvement.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Wang2021">(Wang et al. 2021)</span> The
considerations for battery materials are further explained in the next
chapter.</p>
<h3 id="computational-methods-in-battery-research">Computational methods
in battery research</h3>
<p>FIBs are a likely future alternative to state-of-art lithium-ion
batteries, and due to differences in chemistry, in many ways a blank
slate to build on. This gives the perspective of substantial
improvements, but it also means that research has decades of catching up
to do. Thanks to new techniques, it is possible to speed up some parts
of the research significantly, compared to what was available during the
early development of lithium-ion batteries in the 1980s. In recent
years, computing power has become more readily available, allowing the
study of the atomic and electronic structure and conductivity of
materials computationally in detail, rather than testing the properties
of each material in the lab. Firstly, this allows scientists to
calculate material properties much faster and consistently than is
possible when having to measure properties empirically. Secondly, this
allows to change material properties in a controlled manner with
relatively little effort. By changing one property at the molecular
level, and keeping everything else equal, the simulation can give
insight in the effect of this specific change, whereas in a lab
experiment, this material might be impossible to synthesize in a manner
that the effect of one specific change can be studied in isolation.
Computational analysis also stimulates thinking out-of-the-box: as
experimental research is rather time consuming, researchers tend to
stick to variations of known materials, to avoid risking time and
funding on dead-ends. As more data and computational power has become
available, computational methods are becoming an important driver behind
discovering new battery materials.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Meutzner2018">(Meutzner et al. 2018)</span> In earlier
research, using a database of previously computationally derived

<h3 id="research-goals">Research goals</h3>
<p>The goal of this research is to investigate the feasibility of new
electrode and electrolyte materials for batteries by means of density
functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, as well as
developing computer code to select and analyse the most feasible FIB
materials from an existing database. These methods will be used to
answer the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which fluoride materials have favourable properties to be used as
electrodes in fluoride ion batteries?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the phase diagram of the Bi<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>F<sub>3-x</sub> (M=Sn,Ba,Pb) solid solutions
change with increasing <span

<li><p>What are the conduction pathways of fluoride ions in BiF<sub>3</sub> and BaSnF<sub>4</sub> and how
can the conduction be improved?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thesis-overview">Thesis overview</h3>
<p>Firstly, the relevant theory on batteries in general, and FIBs in
particular will be discussed, including the working principle and
material considerations. In addition, the principles behind the
simulation methods used are treated.</p>
<p>The research itself is divided in three parts, with different
approaches to find suitable FIB materials. In the first part, existing
data of material properties is used to get an overview of which types of
battery materials may be interesting for further research as an FIB
component. In the second part, the structure of the alloy of an
experimentally tested FIB electrode material is predicted. Finally, in
the third part, modifications to an FIB electrode and and electrolyte
material are simulated to establish the detailed effect on the ionic
conductivity.</p>
<p>Finally a conclusion will be given, summarizing the findings and
discussing the implications of the combined results. In the appendix,
the relevant sections of the data analysis code, raw data and simulation
input files can be found.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>In order to give the reader a basis for understanding the motivation
and methods for this research, the relevant theory will be treated in
this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="general-operation-of-a-battery">General operation of a
battery</h3>
<p>Batteries rely on a specific type of controlled chemical reaction to
convert chemical energy into usable electrical energy. This reaction is
an electrochemical redox reaction, which involves a transfer of
electrons combined with a change in oxidation state of the reacting
molecules.</p>
<p>In a battery, there are two electrodes which contain a material that
will release energy when reduced, and a material that will release
energy when oxidized. When connecting the two materials, electrons will
move from the material that is being oxidized (negative electrode), to
the material being reduced (positive electrode). To maintain a neutral
charge, ions will also move between the electrodes. The moving electrons
produce an electrical current. To use this energy for powering an
external load and to prevent the battery from spontaneously releasing
energy, the electrons are required to follow a path through the load.
This is accomplished by placing an electrolyte material between the two
electrodes. The electrolyte does not conduct electrons, but allows ions
through. The electrons will follow an external path, via for example a
wire, and then recombine with the ions at the other electrode.</p>
<h4 id="battery-capacity-and-energy-density">Battery capacity and energy
density</h4>
<p>The highest theoretical energy density out of a pair of electrode
materials is obtained by choosing the redox reaction pairs, or half
reactions, which provide the highest potential difference (voltage)
between them are to be used. In addition, the more electrons exchanged
per redox pair, and the lighter the molecules participating, the more
current the reaction can provide per weight unit.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="voltage">Voltage</h5>
<p>The potential difference of the redox reaction that takes place in
the battery depends on the free energy of the electrodes on each side of
the reaction. Electrons will be drawn to the electrode with the higher
potential. The higher the potential difference, the stronger the force
behind this, which partially influences the energy that the battery can
deliver. The potential difference is derived from the Gibbs free energy
(<span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>) difference between the
redox pair materials: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta G &amp; = \Delta E + P\Delta v - T\Delta S\end{aligned}$$</span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>E</em></span> is the total

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="specific-capacity">Specific capacity</h5>
<p>One of the most important measures of quantifying and comparing the
energy density of various battery chemistries it the specific capacity,
it is defined by:</p>
<h4 id="electrolyte">Electrolyte</h4>
<p>The ability of the electrolyte to allow ions to pass through and
prevent electrons to pass through is essential for the performance of
the battery and worth discussing in more detail. The following four
requirements are important for the electrolyte:<span class="citation"
data-cites="Zhao2019">(Zhao et al. 2019)</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>High ionic conductivity for the charge carrying ion</p></li>
<li><p>Low electronic conductivity</p></li>
<li><p>Suitable electrochemical stability window</p></li>
<li><p>Low resistance across interfaces</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first and second point follow from the basic principle of
operation of a battery. If the ionic conductivity is too low, the
voltage of the battery will drop over the electrolyte, as it will
exhibit a higher electrical resistance. In addition, the rate of charge
and discharge can be limited by the electrolyte in case of a low
conductivity. Low electronic conductivity is required to prevent
unwanted chemical reactions in the electrolyte, a significantly high
electronic conductivity can even lead to short-circuits, which could
cause for example fires.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Gorai2021">(Gorai et al. 2021)</span> The stability window
of an electrolyte indicates the voltage window between the reduction and
oxidation voltage of the electrolyte itself. Exceeding the window during
battery operation, the electrolyte will irreversibly decompose.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Urban2016">(Urban, Seo, and Ceder
2016)</span> To pair electrodes with a certain voltage difference, the
electrolyte used should have at least a larger voltage window. For
example, the stability window of the material can be calculated using
the equation: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
V_{red} &amp; = -\frac{E(\textrm{\ce{BaSnF_6}}) -
E(\textrm{\ce{BaSnF_4}}) - E(\textrm{\ce{BaSnF_4}}) - 2E(\text{F})}{2}\\
V_{ox} &amp; =
-\frac{E(\textrm{\ce{BaSnF_4}})-E(\textrm{\ce{BaF_2}})-E(\text{Sn})
-2E(\text{F})}{2}
\label{eq:basnf4_stab_win}\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>The last point concerns the resistance of interfaces between the
electrolyte and the electrodes on each side. For a liquid electrolyte
this can be an issue when the electrolyte reacts with the electrode
material, forming a less conductive layer. For solid electrolytes, it
can also be a spatial issue, as the materials physically detach,
reducing the number of contact points.</p>
<h3 id="fluoride-ion-batteries">Fluoride ion batteries</h3>
<p>Having established the working principle of batteries and the
relevant qualitative and quantitative properties of the important
materials used in batteries, the defining properties of FIBs and how FIB
materials rate at the previously discussed desirable material properties
can be discussed.</p>
<h4 id="the-best-compromise">The best compromise?</h4>
<p>The motivation behind developing FIBs as a new battery technology of
interest may not be evident, therefore let us consider why FIBs can be
considered a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries and compare
the FIB other alternative battery chemistries in development. In figure
<a href="#fig:radar" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:radar">2.1</a>, some basic, but essential properties
of the significant possible battery charge carrying elements are
compared based on their values for molecular weight, cost (and thereby
indirectly, abundance) and oxidation/reduction potential. The values are
compared on a logarithmic scale of their normalised values, inversed for
values where lower is better (i.e. cost and weight). Considering these
properties, fluoride appears the be the next best charge carrier
following lithium, whilst being cheaper and more abundant in nature.</p>
<p>Going over these other alternatives, they all have some disadvantages
to fluorine:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lithium</strong>: Lightweight and high potential, but
expensive, electrolytes are flammable, long horizon for suitable solid
electrolytes.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Arbizzani2011">(Arbizzani, Gabrielli, and Mastragostino
2011)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Zhao2019">(Zhao et al.
2019)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chloride</strong>: Similar properties to fluoride, but
has a much higher molecular weight and a lower electro negativity than
fluoride, hence resulting in lower energy densities.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Gschwind2017">(Fabienne Gschwind, Euchner,
and Rodriguez-Garcia 2017)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sodium</strong>: Fluoride ions are lighter than sodium
ions, which allows higher theoretical energy densities.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Nowroozi2021">(Nowroozi et al. 2021)</span>
Sodium-ions have similar electrochemical properties to lithium-ions,
although the atomic weight is higher. However, when compared as stored
in host material, the gravimetric energy density in a battery would be
comparable for both chemistries. As sodium-ions have a larger ionic
radius than lithium ions, they cannot be intercalated in the current
graphite anodes and have a lower diffusivity.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Kharbachi2020">(Kharbachi et al. 2020)</span> And because
sodium is a metal itself, it cannot form conversion type electrodes with
metals like fluorine can.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magnesium</strong>: As a multivalent ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) it would
offer high theoretical energy densities, but the higher charge per ion
also makes it more difficult to cycle.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Xiao2021">(Xiao, Galatolo, and Pasta 2021)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potassium</strong>: Is in the same periodic group as
lithium and sodium, though being even heavier than sodium, it would be
unlikely to offer any improvements in energy density.<span

although per weight unit FIBs are not the holy grail, per volume unit
they could be on par with other technologies in development. Hence, at
the same weight as current lithium-ion batteries, FIBs could offer much
higher energy densities in the same package size. Another benefit is the
wide stability window and high electronegativity of fluoride, allowing
high operating voltages.<span class="citation"

<h4 id="working-principle-of-a-fib">Working principle of a FIB</h4>
<p>FIBs operate as has been described before for batteries in general.
Specific to FIBs is the use of the fluoride ion as the charge carrier,
where for example lithium-ion batteries use the lithium ion. The
electrolyte therefore needs to conduct fluoride ions well. One thing of
note is that because the fluoride ion is negatively charged, it moves in
the opposite direction as the electrons, unlike for the positively
charged lithium ion.</p>

hl<span>In case there is an excess of electrons at the anode, which may

<h4 id="electrode-materials">Electrode materials</h4>
<p>Current commercial lithium-ion batteries use intercalation as a
mechanism to reversibly store lithium in a host structure.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Xie2020">(Xie and Lu 2020)</span> This
keeps the structure of the host material intact, which helps to allow
good cycle life of the battery. For redox reactions involving transfer
of a single electron, such as the reduction of the F<sup>-</sup> ion, intercalation
remains possible.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hannah2018">(Hannah

crystal structure, is also possible for some materials. Conversion
reactions offer much higher theoretical energy densities and is
therefore preferred when possible.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Cabana2010">(Cabana et al. 2010)</span> The drawback is that

<p>For FIBs, solid electrolytes are considered instead of the
conventional liquid ones. This is because fluoride ion conducting liquid
electrolytes are generally flammable and thus pose safety risks.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Reddy2011">(Reddy and Fichtner 2011)</span>
In addition there are no liquids known with good fluoride conductivity
at room temperature.<span class="citation"

class="citation" data-cites="Sorokin2007">(Sorokin and Sobolev
2007)</span> The main reason for the lack of suitable liquid
electrolytes is that possible suitable fluoride salts cannot dissolve in
organic solvents. For lithium ion batteries, the electrolyte generally
consists of such lithium salt solutions.</p>
<p>Solid electrolytes in general have several advantages over the
current standard of liquid electrolytes. By virtue of being solid, they
are not easy to puncture, reducing the risk of a short circuit and
subsequent overheating or fire. They can also be applied thinner,
reducing the overall battery weight and size, which is especially useful
as the electrolyte does not contribute directly to the energy stored in
the battery.<span class="citation" data-cites="Crompton2000">(Crompton

have low ionic conductivity at room temperatures. It is expected that a
liquid electrolyte would offer better room temperature ionic

experimentally used widely as of now, it is imperative to improve solid
electrolytes to be able to work at room temperature.<span

<p>With regards to solid fluoride-ion conductors, there are two
materials well known for high conductivity, those being BaSnF<sub>4</sub> and PbSnF<sub>4</sub>.<span

class="citation" data-cites="Denes1991">(Denes et al. 1991)</span> – but
although PbSnF<sub>4</sub> actually has a somewhat higher conductivity, the use of lead is
to be avoided where possible, as it is a toxic material.<span

<p>To increase the conductivity, point defects can be introduced in the
crystal, which is done by doping.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Rongeat2013">(Rongeat et al. 2013)</span> However, too many
defects will reduce the strength of the bulk material<span
class="citation" data-cites="Meutzner2018">(Meutzner et al. 2018)</span>
and the type of dopant as well as the concentration of dopant have a
strong influence on the conductivity.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Patro2013">(Patro and Hariharan 2013)</span> Defects may be
introduced by doping with ions with a different ionic radius, and by
doping with ions with a larger or smaller ionic charge, which will
create vacant sites. For example, BaSnF<sub>4</sub> has fewer interstitial sites than BaF<sub>2</sub>for
fluoride atoms to transport through, however the conductivity is much
higher. This is attributed to the tin atoms adding disorder in the form
of spacing in the lattice.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Denes2007">(Dénès et al. 2007)</span> Another example is
research by <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilkening2016">Wilkening

<h3 id="first-principle-simulations-of-molecules">First-principle
simulations of molecules</h3>
<p>In the previous sections, many material properties that influence
battery performance were mentioned. Measuring each of this properties
for a large number of materials would be a difficult exercise. However
using simulation methods, it is possible to derive most relevant
properties computationally. Physically, properties such as stability of
a material, conductivity and temperature behaviour depend on the
interaction between atoms and electrons within a material. Using
computational methods, these can be simulated and derived.<span
class="citation" data-cites="He2019">(He et al. 2019)</span> The
computational methods are based on the quantum mechanical interactions
in a molecule, which form the basis of physics, hence the name
first-principle (or ab-initio) simulations. It also implies that no
other derived properties are needed as inputs.</p>
<h4 id="density-functional-theory">Density functional theory</h4>
<p>In order to gain information about a material’s molecular level
properties, such as free energy, density functional theory (DFT) is
employed. With DFT, by using the known electronic structure of each
elemental atom as input, the electrochemical properties of molecules can
be calculated among others.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Nazri2009">(Nazri 2009)</span></p>
<p>Each atom may have dozens of electrons in its shells, and one unit
cell of a molecule generally consists of at least several atoms. It is
practically infeasible to model each individual electron interaction.
The solution is to approximate the individual electrons as an electron
density in space.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Meutzner2018">(Meutzner et al. 2018)</span> The DFT method
seeks solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the electron density,
describing how matter behaves at a quantum level. This relies on a
theory by Hohenberg and Kohn which can be interpreted as stating that
the ground-state energy is a unique functional of the ground-state
electron density. Thus if the electron density is known, the energy
density is known too. The implication is that instead of solving the
wave function, there is only a need to solve for the electron density,
which is only three-dimensional, instead of depending on the number of
atoms. In particular, the electron density resulting in the lowest
energy, corresponds to the Schrödinger equation’s solution.<span
class="citation" data-cites="DavidSholl2011">(Sholl and Steckel
2011)</span></p>
<p>Through the Kohn-Sham equations the solution for the electron density
was simplified further, and relies partly on the potential derived from
the electron density itself too. Therefore an iterative approach is
used, starting with an ansatz for the electron density, then solving the
Kohn-Sham equations using this ansatz, deriving the resulting electron
density, and repeating this until there is no change in the electron
density.<span class="citation" data-cites="DavidSholl2011">(Sholl and
Steckel 2011)</span></p>
<p>The energy of a material depends on the how the atoms are distributed
within its structure. However it should be considered that atoms consist
of a heavy nucleus and a number of many orders of magnitude lighter
electrons orbiting around the nucleus. Since the heavy nuclei behave
differently, they can be considered separately in what is named the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.<span class="citation"

properties of a large set of fluoride compounds were analysed to find
compounds with desirable properties for use in FIB. The materials data
was taken from the <a href="https://materialsproject.org/">Materials
Project</a> database,<span class="citation"
data-cites="materialsproject">(Jain et al. 2013)</span> an online,
open-access scientific database containing data of over 100,000
compounds, derived from DFT simulations by scientists worldwide. The
relevant data of each compound to be retrieved includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Molecular formula, to determine the composition, ratio of atoms,
molecular weight, amount of fluoride ion charge carriers.</p></li>
<li><p>Free energy, to determine the stability and the redox pair
voltage.</p></li>
<li><p>Volume, to calculate volume change from defluorination and to

<li><p>Density, to calculate gravimetric and specific capacity

<li><p>Space group, to look for patterns and compare with space groups
that are known to have good cycling stability in other types of

</ul>
<p>The above data can be retrieved directly from the database. The main
challenge is to filter a large set of data into a manageable amount of
most relevant compounds. In addition, the value of derived values, such
as voltage, can depend on the calculation method used, for example by
omitting intermittent phases the calculated voltage will differ somewhat
from experimental data. The process used is summarized in figure <a
href="#fig:mp_scheme" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mp_scheme">1.1</a>. The first step is to retrieve
materials from the database that contain fluoride atoms. In order to
keep the dataset manageable, and since the primary focus of present
research is on metal-fluorides, the query is limited to binary and
ternary fluorides. This can include materials such as , and . The next
step is to discard materials that are unstable based on their energy
above the hull. The energy above the hull gives a measure of the
decomposition energy of a material, for <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub>above hull</sub> = 0</span> the
material is thermodynamically stable,<span class="citation"
data-cites="Evrenk2014">(Atahan-Evrenk and Aspuru-Guzik
2014a)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Hautier2011">(Hautier et
al. 2011)</span> so the filter selects for this. For the next step, the
materials are categorized by linking them with external data sources,
namely their periodic table group,<span class="citation"
data-cites="GoodmanSciences">(GoodmanSciences, n.d.)</span> and whether
they are solid at room temperature. For the latter, where available, the
melting points data was obtained from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics.<span class="citation" data-cites="Haynes2017">(Haynes
2017)</span> It should be noted that some materials that are not solid
may have slipped through this filter as the reference table contains
fewer fluoride listings than the Materials Project database does.</p>
<p>The subsequent step can be considered the most important: the
fluoride compounds are matched to defluorinated compounds, constructing
the redox half-reaction for the material. For example is matched with ,
corresponding to the reaction . In addition, partially defluorinated
compounds are also matched, such as , this can be used to determine how
through how many equilibrium voltage steps the material goes upon
defluorination. For ternary materials, care is taken to ensure that the
ratio of the other atoms is also the same in the matched material, e.g.
should be matched to and not to .</p>
<p>With both the fluorides and the corresponding defluorinated material
known, the theoretical half cell voltage of the materials can be
calculated, using their free energy values from the database and
equation <a href="#eq:voltage2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:voltage2">[eq:voltage2]</a>. A correction is applied
for cases such as /: the number of should match on both sides, so
effectively, during the reaction <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 3 − (8/3) = 1/3</span> fluoride ions
are reduced.</p>
<p>In order to check whether appropriate filters and calculation methods
are used, the code is also tested for lithium ion battery materials.
Since there is much more experimental data for these materials, this can
be compared to the DFT derived data to judge the correctness of the
computational data and of the code to analyze it.</p>
<p>In total 480 pairs of fluoride containing materials and the
corresponding material in defluorinated form were analysed, including
312 unique fully fluorinated compounds. This set was obtained by
querying all stable (E above hull <span class="math inline"> = 0</span>)
fluoride containing binary, ternary and quaternary fluoride-containing
materials from Materials Project, followed by querying the corresponding
unfluorinated formulas. The fluorides and corresponding materials were
then matched and paired based on their fluoride contents. The voltage is
presented against the reference voltage of a hypothetical pure fluor
electrode (), as was also done in prior DFT research by <span

<h3 id="results-and-discussion">Results and discussion</h3>
<p>To test whether the database values and calculation method correspond
with experimental data, it is compared with known data for lithium ion
batteries, as there is more experimental data available lithium ion
electrode materials. In figure <a href="#lithium_references"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lithium_references">1.2</a>,
literature values for the potential of some common electrode materials
is compared to the values derived from the Materials Project database.
It can be noted that there is a relatively small discrepancy for most
materials. This can be explained by the reference values being based on
experimental data. In experiments there will be capacity and voltage
losses from matters such as internal resistance, inability to fully
cycle the battery and measurement. The large disparity between the
literature and calculated voltage of For the difference is also around 1
V, this may be explained due to the fact that the Python code calculates
the average voltage, whereas in practice, the material is delithiated
over several voltage plateaus, where the highest voltage is reported in
the literature data.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Vitins1997">(Vitins and West 1997)</span> In the case of ,
the first voltage plateau is indeed at around 4.5 V, with a second
plateau 1 V lower. When considering this, the calculated value is only
slight below the average voltage as reported in literature.</p>
<p>Although literature data for FIBs is more scarce, there are a handful
of materials for which comparison values are available. These potentials
are shown in figure <a href="#fluoride_references"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fluoride_references">1.3</a>.
In this case, only theoretical voltages and capacities against / were
available, the potential of the lithium half reaction is close to that
of fluoride (-3.03 and -2.86 respectively), hence they can be readily
compared. Across the board there is a larger discrepancy in the voltage
than for the lithium-ion electrode materials, which may be due to the
DFT-derived values for lithium materials being better validated and
corrected due to more research interest. However the general order is
still correct for most materials. In addition, a few experimentally
determined voltages of FIB cells were available from literature, these
values are compared in table <a href="#tab:experimental_FIB_values"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:experimental_FIB_values">1.1</a>. As can be
expected, generally the calculated voltage is somewhat higher than the
experimentally measured voltage, which is subject to inefficiency
losses.</p>
<p>For the capacities, shown in <a href="#fluoride_capacity_references"

data-reference="fluoride_capacity_references">1.4</a>, the values
correspond to the literature reported theoretical capacities, except for

<p>Having established that the model offers reasonably accurate
predictions of cell voltages and capacity, it was used on the large
dataset. In figure <a href="#fig:volume_change"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:volume_change">1.5</a> the
specific capacities are plotted against the voltage and coloured by the
volume change. Materials with a large volume change are likely to damage
a battery, hence lower volume change materials are more desirable.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Zhang2018">(Xu Zhang et al. 2018)</span>
The volume change is defined as the percentage difference in volume by
<span

where <span class="math inline"><em>V</em><sub>M</sub></span> is the
volume of the defluorinated material, and <span
class="math inline"><em>V</em><sub>MF</sub></span> the volume of the
fluorinated material. The volume of the respective materials was
retrieved directly from the Materials Project database and corrected for
the number of atoms per unit cell. From research on lithium-ion battery
electrodes, it is known that a large volume change compromises cell
performance, mainly by causing the electrode to fall apart and losing
electrical contact, and also by lowering the potential as part of it is
stored in mechanical strain of the crystal lattice.<span

data-cites="Chae2017">(Chae et al. 2017)</span> hence in this research,
a maximum volume change of 100% is targeted in the graph colour scale
and filtering.</p>
<p>In figure <a href="#fig:volume_change" data-reference-type="ref"

materials just outside the band could be feasible.<span class="citation"

be expected from the distribution of all materials. A reasons could be
that first of all, the database of all materials also includes a large

<p>Another categorization to investigate the retrieved data is to show
them by periodic table group. In figure <a href="#Ptable_all"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Ptable_all">[Ptable_all]</a>a
the materials are plotted by the periodic table category. The definition
of each category is colour coded in the periodic table of figure figure
<a href="#Ptable_all" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="Ptable_all">[Ptable_all]</a>b. Many of the materials
with good capacity and a voltage low enough to be compatible with many
electrolytes are transition metals, while lanthanides could offer high
voltages. In the figures <a href="#fig:transmetals"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:transmetals">1.14</a> to
<a href="#fig:alkearthmetals" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:alkearthmetals">1.15</a>, the materials are plotted
separately for each periodic table group with the materials labeled.
Some patterns that can be described are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most transition metal fluorides have relatively low potentials,
as they are between the strong reducting elements and the strong
oxidizing elements.</p></li>
<li><p>There are few stable fluoride oxides that meet the main criteria:
stable, solid at room temperature, matching defluorinated material. A
likely explanation is that fluorine itself is also a strong oxidizing
material and chemically quite similar to oxygen. When removing fluoride
from an oxyfluoride, the material will become reducing and it will be
energentically favourable to attract oxygen to replace the
fluoride.</p></li>
<li><p>The carbon group as defined in this context consists of only
carbon, silicon and germanium. The reason for only germanium fluorides
being left in the filtered dataset is that most carbon and silicon
fluorides are gaseous at room temperature. The remaining germanium
fluorides might behave similar as silicon in lithium-silicon batteries:
undergoing a large volume change that results in the bulk electrode
falling apart.</p></li>
<li><p>The transition metal fluorides show an interesting pattern, a
group of materials are conveniently in the voltage window. However
little could be found about the properties of these hexafluoride salts,
other than their successful synthesis in a 1978 paper.<span

and Devine 2006)</span> This reaction takes place at over 4 V, hence the
potential of reducing will be too high to be used as an electrode, also
evidenced by how far it is from the stability window of .</p></li>
<li><p>Many of the nitrogen-group fluorides are in or near the stability
window of , although most are antimony fluorides. The phosphorous
hexafluoride salts such as are commonly used as electrolytes in aqueous
solutions. However when dissolved, they split in for example , hence the
fluorine remains bound.<span class="citation"

<li><p>Lanthanide fluorides</p></li>
<li><p>The alkali metal fluorides show a few binary fluorides, these are
not suitable as electrodes, as elemental sodium, potassium and lithium
will be highly reactive.</p></li>
<li><p>The binary alkaline earth metals have very high potentials,
outside the stability window of possible electrolytes, withthe exception
of and . The palladium fluorides are not relevant, palladium is a very
expensive metal.</p></li>

<p>While voltage and specific capacity give a good indication as to how
energy dense a material is, the volumetric capacity is also of interest.

potential theoretical densities than other battery chemistries.<span

chemistries that specialize in high volumetric energy density
applications, such as battery electric vehicles, might be preferred. The
high volumetric capacity of FIBs is reflected in the results shown in
figure <a href="#fig:vol_vs_gravi" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:vol_vs_gravi">1.16</a>. Transition metal fluorides
and lanthanide fluorides have higher energy densities on average, and
offer a large choice in materials. The capacities may seem rather high,
this is because the graph only covers single electrodes. The capacities
for any combination of electrodes are shown in figure <a

group of high voltage redox pairs around 1500 Wh/L, and the bulk of

<p>The relevant results of the simulation are obtained from the
<em>OSZICAR</em> file, which gives the free energy for each iteration.
The most precise free energy is taken from the last iteration in the
file.</p>
<p>To investigate the effect of doping, the stability of three different
doping variants was tested using DFT simulations, to find which form
will be encountered when synthesizing a solid solution.</p>
<p>A supercell of crystal, containing 16 atoms and 48 atoms, was used in
DFT simulations. This size of supercell allowed a balance between
starting with relatively low dopant ratios and still having manageable
calculation times. To virtually dope the material, , , respectively,
were added manually in the crystal structure, where they replaced an
atom in no particular order. The structure was then optimized
computationally to find the highest total distances between atoms for
the specified number of atoms removed. Of these optimizations, the 10
best optimized structure were used for DFT simulations. The motivation
behind this, is that the simple distance-based optimization can be
completed quickly, while the DFT simulations take much longer. With 10
structures, the more accurate energy calculated by DFT is expected to be
among them. For the leftmost point, no vacancies are present, hence only
one energy value can be plotted.</p>
<p>The method described above was performed for both orthorombic (Pnma)
, and for rhombic prism (P<span
class="math inline">6<sub>3</sub></span>) and cubic (Fm<span
class="math inline">$\bar{3}$</span>m) . Pnma is the most stable
structure, whereas the other space group structures correspond to the
most stable structures of the compounds consisting of pure bismuth and
dopant. Starting from pure it is known that the Pnma structure has the
lowest energy, wheras at 100% doping ratio, the previously mentioned
space groups have the lowest energy. By combining convex hulls of two
structures of the same materials, the phase change point is expected to
be visible from the convex hull.</p>
<p>To study the phases formed when doping a material, a convenient way
of visualizing the stability of the phases is to plot the energies of
various compositions against the ratio of dopant. This kind of graph is
known as a convex hull. A hull line is drawn through the lowest
energies, as if it were a string pulled around a number of poles. Any
point above the hull are considered unstable, and unlikely to form
naturally. Any points on the hull are expected to form when gradually
doping a material. A hull is constructed by first generating 10
structures with the respective formulas and the highest total distance
between their atoms. These 10 structures are then simulated using DFT to
obtain their final energy in relaxed state. These values can be plotted
separately as convex hulls for each space group by: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Convex hull} = E_x -
\frac{x}{16}E_{16}-\left(1-\frac{x}{16}\right)E_0\end{aligned}$$</span>
Where <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span>
indicates the lowest energy of the 10 simulations for each <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> in a formula . To combine these
plots for both space groups, the lowest <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>x</em></sub></span> of both space
groups determines the lowest energy, most stable, phase of each
stochiometry. Hence in the combined graph, the lowest value can be
either space group, which will be marked by their respective colours in
the plots.</p>

href="#Convex_hull_BiPbF" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="Convex_hull_BiPbF">[Convex_hull_BiPbF]</a> the energies
of intermediate phases are plotted for two space groups. As shown in
table <a href="#convex_hull_table" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="convex_hull_table">2.1</a>, for each end of the plot,
one of the spacegroups is more stable, thus it is of interest to
determine how the materials behave when mixed. The hulls for the space
groups are also shown separate for clarity, but it should be noted that
the combined hull is closer to what can be expected when synthesizing
these materials in the lab, as the space groups can change depending on
which has a more favourable energy. What can be seen is that the
intermediate phases are close the the hull. In practice, even those
phased less than 100 meV above the hull may be metastable and
observable.</p>
<p>Due to constraints in the available calculation time, not all
simulations could be completed on time, however based on the completed
set of it is expected that the values of each set of 10 simulations are
relatively close together, not affecting the shape of the hull
qualitatively.</p>
<p>The convex hulls of , and are similar, which is not surprising
considering their similar properties and what has been noted in prior
literature. As can be expected from table <a href="#convex_hull_table"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="convex_hull_table">2.1</a>,
for pure , the Pnma structure indeed has the lowest energy.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Konishi2020">Konishi et al.

class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 0.4</span>, which had a Pnma
orthorhombic phase, a P3c1 hexagonal phase, and a Fm3m cubic phase
respectively. The cubic phase for <span

hexagonal phase was not studied in this research.</p>
<p>While only the combined hull of drops below zero, indicating a stable
phase, the two other solid solutions are also close to zero and may be
possible to synthesize. The , solid solution is furthest above the hull,
this can be expected, as seen from table <a href="#convex_hull_table_2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="convex_hull_table_2">2.2</a>,
even pure with this space group is not stable. The result also
corresponds to what cam be expected from table <a

<h3 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h3>
<p>For this part simulations in the time domain are be performed
concerning the mobility of fluoride ions in an electrolyte and an
electrode material. For both materials this was simulated for a range of
temperatures and number of defects, as it was found from the literature
study that defects could improve the ionic conductivity of the
materials. The simulations over varying temperatures allow for
calculating properties such as the ionic conductivity and activation
energy, and to compare them for different types of defects. Simulating
each structure for a range of temperatures is important, as the
temperature has a large effect on the conductivity, regardless of its
structure.</p>
<p>Besides the earlier discussed electrode material it is chosen to
study as it is the first FIB electrolyte that has been demonstrated to
function at room temperature.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Mohammad2019a">(Mohammad et al. 2019)</span></p>
<h3 id="methodology-1">Methodology</h3>
<p>The files describing the structure of each material were obtained
from the Materials Project database<span class="citation"
data-cites="materialsproject">(Jain et al. 2013)</span> and constructed
into a supercell with roughly equal dimensions in each spatial
direction. The supercell was then modified to simulate doping and/or
defects. The location of these was chosen based on the simulation
results of the unmodified structures as well as from the literature
described in the theory section.</p>
<h4 id="input-files">Input files</h4>
<p>The simulation were performed using the program VASP. VASP requires
four input files for molecular dynamics simulations. These are the
<em>INCAR</em> file (see figure <a href="#fig:incar_md"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:incar_md">[fig:incar_md]</a>), <em>KPOINTS</em>
file, <em>POSCAR</em> file and <em>POTCAR</em> file. The purpose of
these files was explained in section <a href="#4_2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="4_2">2.2</a>. The INCAR file,
shown in figure <a href="#fig:incar_md" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:incar_md">[fig:incar_md]</a>, is slightly different,
the value of <code>IBRION</code> is changed to <span
class="math inline">0</span> to perform molecular dynamics simulations.
In addition, for MD simulations the temperature is also a factor. For
each simulation a constant temperature was used, reflected in the start
and end temperature being equal.</p>

<p>For the MD simulations a pre-defined Monkhorst-Pack KPOINTS mesh of 1
1 1 was used, which speeds up the simulation. This is recommended since
MD simulations are more computationally intensive than DFT simulations.
For each structure, a relaxation (DFT simulation) was first performed,
and the resulting structure taken from the <em>CONTCAR</em> file was
used as input structure (POSCAR file) for the molecular dynamics
simulation. The POTCAR file is obtained directly from the included
pseudopotentials of VASP.</p>
<p>The simulations were performed at temperatures ranging between 700
and 1800 K. This is much higher than the desired room temperature
operation, however it was chosen since higher temperature simulations
allow for more jumps within the simulation time frame, and thus
statistically more relevant results within a relatively short simulation
time.</p>
<h5 id="input-files-1"> input files</h5>
<p>For , the most stable structure, Pnma, was used as a basis. This
structure was subsequently modified to introduce specific defects. As
the goal was to investigate doping of the material with in detail, the
main aspects of this doping were simulated both by themselves and
combined. The simulations were performed on a 2x1x1 supercell to allow a
minimum doping ratio of 12.5 mol %.</p>

ions." Looking at the structure in figure <a href="#fig:BaSnF4_vesta"

the fluoride atoms in this layer are "mobile at room temperature" hence
creating vacancies on these sites would not be expected to make a large

used, which takes the VASP output file <em>OUTCAR</em> as input. The
code processes the OUTCAR file to obtain information about the atom
positions over time, allowing the visualize the diffusion path of each
atom over time, and to calculate molecular dynamics properties for
spefici sites and atoms. The code was modified to visualize the new

<p>The results of the simulations of and the derivative structures are

undoped , substituting one or two for (), only creating vacancies as in

as the valence state of the is lower by one compared to for in this
case, for each atom subsituted, the material can contain one less when
maintaining a neutral oxidation state. The results show that the
activation energy and conductivity are clearly affected by the number of
vacancies. However the effect of doping with without any vacancies is
much less than that of creating vacancies. Hence it can be posed that
the vacancies are the main driver behind improved conductivity and
reduced activation energy, although when combined with the doping of
atoms, the conductivity is improved even further.</p>
<p>In figure <a href="#fig:BiF3_Pnma_per_site" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:BiF3_Pnma_per_site">3.2</a> the mobility of the 8d

data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:BiF3_md_3d">[fig:BiF3_md_3d]</a>b, the less mobile
4c sites can be bypassed using only jumps between 8d sites, hence the 4c

This can be explained due to the extrapolation instead of directly
simulating at room temperatures resulting in inaccuracies in twofold
manner: the fitline itself has a large error, as there are relatively
few data points, and the slope of the fit line is reported to change at
lower temperatures.<span class="citation"

recommendations</h2>
<p>The major hurdles of finding suitable electrodes and improving
conductivity of the electrolyte materials were studied.</p>
<h3 id="computational-screening-of-fib-materials-1">Computational
screening of FIB materials</h3>
<p>From the high-throughput analysis method of battery materials,
currently experimentally studied electrodes and were identified, and one
new materials, , which has received little scientific interest so far.
Although not giving many new options, the same methodology can be
applied readily in case electrolytes with wider electrochemical
stability windows are discovered. For example, an experimental
electrolyte with a stability window of 1.8 V was described by <span
class="citation" data-cites="Wang2021">Wang et al. (2021)</span>,
broadening the possible range from that of significantly.</p>
<p>For more complicated materials, it may be helpful to compile a more
specific list of formulas to query. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Cheng2015">Cheng et al. (2015)</span> propose using a
computational molecule generator to find materials similar to a known
material.</p>
<p>The Python code used for this research can also be modified and
expanded to electrolyte materials, applying the formula for calculating
their stability window on a large dataset.</p>
<h3 id="phase-stability-after-doping"> phase stability after doping</h3>
<p>Using the DFT simulations and the convex hull, it was proven that the
structure of doped changes its space group around a 50% dopant
ratio.</p>
<p>In literature it was found that metal fluorides and type materials in
general shared a same space group with only their lattice parameters
differing. Mixing these materials together could thus introduce defects
without affecting the bulk strength of the structure.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Denes1991">(Denes et al. 1991)</span></p>
<h3 id="ionic-conductivity-of">Ionic conductivity of </h3>
<p>From molecular dynamics simulations, it was found that the ionic
conductivity of could be substantially improved by doping with . The
improvement in conductivity was found to be caused by the combination of
atoms replacing some atoms, and by the additional fluoride site
vacancies.</p>
<h3 id="ionic-conductivity-of-1">Ionic conductivity of </h3>
<p>and the closely related have been studied quite extensively for
fluoride conductivity outside of FIB application. Through molecular
dynamics simulations it was shown that these prior results can be
replicated for , showing anisotropic conductivity as the - layer blocks
fluoride mobility. By modifying the material with additional fluoride
site vacancies in this layer, it was shown that the conductivity can be
improved and the activation energy was reduced by up to 25%.</p>
<p>A study by <span class="citation" data-cites="Patro2011">Patro and
Hariharan (2011)</span> investigated if different preparation methods
could improve the conductivity of . It was found that smaller crystal
sizes result in better ionic conductivity, also related to defects. For
an experimental research it would be interesting to try and recreate the
types of specific defects studied in this thesis and to study the
conductivity of a real sample.</p>
<p>Research by <span class="citation" data-cites="Liu2020">L. Liu, Yang,
Shao, et al. (2020)</span>, and <span class="citation"
data-cites="Patro2013">Patro and Hariharan (2013)</span> has shown that
doping with improves the conductivity. The cations replace cations by ,
where the ideal ratio for conductivity was found to be around <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 0.02</span>.</p>
<p>Constructing convex hulls for solid solutions would be a natural next
step. Different doping compositions of this material have been studied,
but this research took place several decades ago.<span class="citation"
data-cites="DENES1984">(G.Dénès et al. 1984)</span> The use of DFT would
give better control of the doping ratios and resulting energy
values.</p>
<h3 id="further-research">Further research</h3>
<p>While DFT is considered one of the best current methods for
computationally determining the ionic conductivity of materials, it is
limited to short timescales and only a few supercells. Other methods can
be employed to study the effect of defects in the larger crystal
structure, and how the combination of electrodes and electrolyte
performs.<span class="citation" data-cites="Meutzner2018">(Meutzner et
al. 2018)</span></p>
<p>During the development of lithium-ion batteries, conversion type
electrodes were also the first to be used widely, however battery
failures that resulted in human injury resulted in intercalation
electrodes becoming the standard.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Xie2020">(Xie and Lu 2020)</span> This would require
entirely different electrode materials. Now that current battery
technology is close to hitting a ceiling in specific capacity, there is
renewed interest in conversion type electrodes, as they offer much high
theoretical energy densities.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Cabana2010">(Cabana et al. 2010)</span> As development of
FIBs progresses, intercalation electrodes may be required as well for
safe application, and studying fluoride intercalation compounds could
help further FIB development.</p>
